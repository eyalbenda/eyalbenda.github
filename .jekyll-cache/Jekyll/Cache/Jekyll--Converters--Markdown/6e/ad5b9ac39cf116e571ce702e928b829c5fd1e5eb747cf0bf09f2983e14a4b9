<p>The overarching goal of our research is to understand how genetic variation shapes phenotypic diversity. Genetic variation shapes phenotypic diﬀerences within populations and between species. We study this question in <em>C. elegans</em> and related species. Combining the powerful tools available for studying the <em>C. elegans</em> model with innovative genomic technologies, we strive to elucidate basic principles of how genetic variation shapes our natural world.</p>

<p><strong>We like to think that our genes work for us, but sometimes it’s the other way around</strong>. <img src="/images/slider7001400/pha1.png" alt="A worm (left) poisoned by a toxin-antidote element. Its pharynx failed to develop and it died shortly after hatching" style="width: 300px; float: right; border: 10px" />Selfish genes are everywhere, and as our work has shown, sometimes they’re found where you’d least expect them. We recently discovered that a gene long thought to be essential for development of is actually a selfish gene - part of a toxin-antidote selfish element (Ben-David et al, <em>Science</em> 2017). Toxin-antidote elements cause an individual to kill their offspring, like the worm shown here (left), whose pharynx failed to develop and it died shortly after hatching (right picture shows a normal worm hatchling). Since then, we have since then discovered six more elements in two other worm species (Ben-David et al, <em>Biorxiv</em> 2020).
How widespread are these elements in animals? What is their role in evolution? How do they work? These are all open questions we would like to answer.</p>
