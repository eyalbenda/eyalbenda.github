<p>The overarching goal of our research is to understand how genetic variation shapes phenotypic diversity. We study this question in <em>C. elegans</em> and related species. Combining the powerful tools available for studying the <em>C. elegans</em> model with innovative genomic technologies, we strive to elucidate basic principles of how genetic variation shapes our natural world.</p>

<p><strong>We like to think that our genes work for us, but sometimes itâ€™s the other way around</strong>. <img src="/images/slider7001400/pha1.png" alt="A worm (left) poisoned by a toxin-antidote element. Its pharynx failed to develop and it died shortly after hatching" style="width: 300px; float: right; border: 10px" />Selfish genes, who do nothing but ensure their survival, are everywhere. Sometimes, theyâ€™re even found where youâ€™d least expect them. During my postdoctoral work, we discovered that a gene long thought to be essential for worm development is, in fact, a selfish gene - part of a toxin-antidote selfish element (Ben-David et al, <em>Science</em> 2017). Toxin-antidote elements cause an individual to kill their offspring, like the worm shown here (left), whose pharynx failed to develop and it died shortly after hatching (right picture shows a normal worm hatchling). Since then, we have since then discovered six more elements in two other worm species (Ben-David et al, <em>Biorxiv</em> 2020).
How widespread are these elements in animals? What is their role in evolution? How do they work? These are all open questions we would like to answer.</p>

<p><strong>Genetic variation affects the expression of every gene in our genome. <img src="/images/respic/sc.png" alt="" style="width: 300px; float: right; border: 10px" /> We study this relationship at the cellular level</strong>. One of the features that make <em>C. elegans</em> such a powerful model organism for genetics is that every individual has the same cellular composition. When combined with a cutting-edge genomics tool - single cell RNA sequencing - we can profile gene expression in the entire worm at cellular resolution. For example, the image on the right shows the clustering of about 50,000 <em>C. elegans</em> cells (Ben-David et al., <em>Biorxiv</em> 2020). Different groups (clusters) correspond to different cell types in the worm: muscles, intestinal cells, neurons â€“ itâ€™s all there. We are using this approach to study how genetic variation affects gene expression at unprecedented resolution. Our ultimate goal of gaining a comprehensive understanding of regulatory variationâ€™s role in shaping phenotypes within and between species.</p>
