I"	<p><strong>September 2020 Update: Ben-David lab launching soon! We will be actively recruiting a lab manager and students at all levels. See <a href="openings">openings</a></strong></p>

<p>The goal of our research is to understand how genetic variation shapes phenotypic diversity. Genetic variation shapes phenotypic diﬀerences within populations and between species. We study this question in <em>C. elegans</em> and related species. Combining the powerful tools available for studying the <em>C. elegans</em> mode with leading edge genomics technologies, we strive to elucidate basic principles of how genetic variation shapes our natural world.</p>

<p>We are funded by the <a href="www.huji.ac.il">Hebrew University</a>, and the <a href="www.isf.org.il">Israeli Science Foundation</a></p>
