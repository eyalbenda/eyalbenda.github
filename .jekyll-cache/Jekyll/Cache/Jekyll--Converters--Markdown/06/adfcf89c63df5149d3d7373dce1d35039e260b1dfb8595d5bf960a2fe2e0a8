I"Ý<p>The overarching goal of our research is to understand how genetic variation shapes phenotypic diversity. We study this question in <em>C. elegans</em> and related species. Combining the powerful tools available for studying the <em>C. elegans</em> model with innovative genomic technologies, we strive to elucidate basic principles of how genetic variation shapes our natural world.</p>
