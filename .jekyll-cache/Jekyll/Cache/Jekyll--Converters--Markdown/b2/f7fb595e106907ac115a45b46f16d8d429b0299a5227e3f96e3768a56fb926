<p>The overarching goal of our research is to understand how genetic variation shapes phenotypic diversity. Genetic variation shapes phenotypic diï¬€erences within populations and between species. We study this question in <em>C. elegans</em> and related species. Combining the powerful tools available for studying the <em>C. elegans</em> model with innovative genomic technologies, we strive to elucidate basic principles of how genetic variation shapes our natural world.</p>

<p><strong>We like to think that our genes work for us, but sometimes itâ€™s the other way around</strong>. Selfish genes are found all over our genome, and as our work has shown, sometimes theyâ€™re found where youâ€™d least expect them. We recently discovered that a gene long thought to be essential for worm development is actually a selfish gene, part of a class called toxin-antidote elements (Ben-David et al, <em>Science</em> 2017). Toxin-antidote elements cause an individual to kill their offspring, unless they also inherit it.</p>
