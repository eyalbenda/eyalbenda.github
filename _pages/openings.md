The lab is committed to creating a nurturing, positive enviroment for learning and research excellence. 

## Lab manager

A lab manager is the beating heart of the lab. I'm looking for someone who is self-motivated and driven, and who will work with me to advance both the educational (student supervision) and the research goals of the lab. If you love and care about science and want to build something special together - <a href = "mailto: eyal.bendavid@mail.huji.ac.il.">I want to work with you!</a>


## Student positions

The Ben-David lab is recruiting students at all levels. Our work combines bench work with the amazing *C. elegans* model with advanced computational genomic analyses. If this combination appeals to you and it's something you want to learn, <a href = "mailto: eyal.bendavid@mail.huji.ac.il.">apply here</a>
