The overarching goal of our research is to understand how genetic variation shapes phenotypic diversity. We study this question in *C. elegans* and related species. Combining the powerful tools available for studying the *C. elegans* model with innovative genomic technologies, we strive to elucidate basic principles of how genetic variation shapes our natural world.


**October 2020 Update: Ben-David lab is launching and recruiting a lab manager and students at all levels. See [openings](openings)**
